# BetsAndBravery
Bets and Bravery is a game I used to run on a reddit forum based around a manga series named One Piece. This is a webscraper that accesses the reddit threads and pulls out the bets people make, and organizes them into a spreadsheet for me! (no real money is actually used in any of these threads, everything is done in fun)
